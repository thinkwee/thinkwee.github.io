# About Me
-	I'm Wei Liu. Here is my [Email](mailto:thinkwee2767@gmail.com) and [Github](https://github.com/thinkwee).
-	Acquired Bachelor of Communication Engineering at BUPT in 2018.9-2021.7
-	Acquired Master of Computer Engineering at CIST@BUPT(Center of Intelligence Science and Technology) in 2021
-	Now works at Tencent as Application Researcher, focusing on NLP for Recommendation, Advertising.

# Professional Experience
-	CIST@BUPT, 2018.9-2021.7
	-	Guided by Dr.Lei Li. Focusing on natural language generation, especially on abstractive summarization
	-	During my master's degree, my research project is about "Strong Abstractive Summarization" (as opposed to Weak Abstractive Summarization, which degenerates to Extractive Summarization), focusing on the "text degeneration problem" in early deep learning network-based abstractive summarization models. This phenonmenon will harm the performance of summarization systems behind search engine, dialogue and new summarization. The research was done from three perspectives: model<sup>[1]</sup>, data<sup>[2]</sup> and task definition.
	-	I also participated in several workshops, including Scitific Paper Summarization<sup>[3]</sup>, Multi-lingual Summarization<sup>[4]</sup> and Extreme Long Text Summarization<sup>[5]</sup>.
</br>   
-	Application Research Intern, Sina Weibo, 2019.6-2019.9
	-	Apply pretrained language models with data augment techniques to improve blog classification and meet highly customisable requirements.  
	-	Extract blog keywords for downstream ranking and searching. Develop a two-tower based scoring method (modified DUET) to perform keyword extraction.
</br>   
-	Application Research Intern, Tencent AIPD, 2020.5-2021.3
	-	Develop KeyPhrase Ranking method based on Machine Reading Comprehension for news feed in Tencent.
	-	Develop KeyPhrase Generation method based on a unified extract&generate model<sup>[6]</sup> for news feed in Tencent.
</br>   
-	Application Researcher, Tencent MLPD, 2021.7-present
	-	Develop Controllable Keyphrase Generation<sup>[7]</sup> for news feed in Tencent.
	-	Improve the factuality of LLM-generated texts<sup>[8]</sup> for news feed in Tencent.
	-	Apply Graph Embeddings in Tencent Ads recommmendation.
	-	Introducing content feeds information into Tencent Ads recommendation with a special modeling method.
	-	Develop the next generation of two-tower models in Tencent Ads.
