# About Me
-	Hello, my name is Wei Liu. You can reach me via[Email](mailto:thinkwee2767@gmail.com), [Github](https://github.com/thinkwee) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=QvW2leIAAAAJ).
-	I earned a Bachelor of Communication Engineering from BUPT in 2018.
-	I completed my Master of Computer Engineering at CIST@BUPT (Center of Intelligence Science and Technology) in 2021.
-	Currently, I am working at Tencent as an Applied Researcher, specializing in NLP for Recommendation and Advertising.

# Experience
-	CIST@BUPT, 2018.9-2021.7
	-	Supervised by Dr.Lei Li, my research focused on developing a "Highly Summarised Abstractive Summarization System".
	-	I found the "text degeneration problem" in early seq2seq-based summarization models, where the text generated by abstractive summarization models is identical to the extracted content from articles. To create a truly "Highly Summarised" summarization model capable of summarizing, reorganizing, and compressing text, I investigated this phenomenon from three perspectives: model<sup>[1]</sup>, data<sup>[2]</sup>, and task definition.
	-	Additionally, I participated in various workshops addressing real-world challenges in summarization, including Scientific Paper Summarization<sup>[3]</sup>, Multi-lingual and Low-Resource Summarization<sup>[4]</sup> and Extreme Long Text Summarization<sup>[5]</sup>.
</br>   
-	Application Research Intern, Sina Weibo, 2019.6-2019.9
	-	Implemented BERT for blog classification in real-world production environments.  
	-	Improved the two-tower based scoring method (modified DUET) for keyword extraction.
</br>   
-	Application Researcher (including internship), Tencent AIPD, 2020.5-2022.5
	-	Mainly focused on strengthening NLU capabilities to enhance Tencent's news feed recommendations.
	-	Incorporated Machine Reading Comprehension techniques for Keyphrase Ranking.
	-	Develop Keyphrase Prediction method based on a unified extract&generate model<sup>[6]</sup>.
	-	Explored Controllable Keyphrase Generation as an early attempt at prompt engineering<sup>[7]</sup>.
	-	Reduce the hallucination in the LLM-generated texts<sup>[8]</sup>.
</br>   
-	Application Researcher, Tencent MLPD, 2022.5-present
	-	Concentrated on improving the accuracy of Tencent Advertisement Recommendation in the view of model-centric and data-centric.
	-	Model-Centric: developed graph models, sequence modelling, diffusion model<sup>[10]</sup> and interaction-enhanced two-tower model<sup>[11]</sup> for Tencent Ads.
	-	Data-Centric: developed feature quantization and feature AutoML techniques for Tencent Ads.
