# About Me
-	Hello, my name is Wei Liu. Here are my [Email](mailto:thinkwee2767@gmail.com), [Github](https://github.com/thinkwee) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=QvW2leIAAAAJ).
-	I earned a Bachelor of Communication Engineering from BUPT in 2018.
-	I completed my Master of Computer Engineering at CIST@BUPT (Center of Intelligence Science and Technology) in 2021.
-	Currently, I am working at Tencent as an Applied Researcher, specializing in NLP for Recommendation and Advertising.

# Experience
-	CIST@BUPT, 2018.9-2021.7
	-	Under the supervision of Dr. Lei Li, my research focused on the development of a "Highly Summarised Abstractive Summarization System".
	-	I found the "text degeneration problem" in seq2seq-based summarization models, where the text generated by abstractive summarization models is exactly the same as the extracted sentences from articles. To develop a truly "Highly Summarised" summarization model capable of summarizing, reorganizing, and compressing text, I investigated this problem from three perspectives:
		-	model<sup>[1]</sup>: I introduced Determinantal Point Processes into Abstractive Summarization for the first time and improved the attention distribution in deep seq2seq models.
		-	data<sup>[2]</sup>: I discovered that public summarization datasets contain subjective bias from manual labeling, which leads to the text degeneration problem under supervised settings.
		-	task definition: I explored the influence of extract/generate proportion within the summarization task on the degeneration problem.
	-	Additionally, I engaged in various workshops addressing real-world challenges in summarization, including Scientific Paper Summarization<sup>[3]</sup>, Multi-lingual and Low-Resource Summarization<sup>[4]</sup> and Extreme Long Text Summarization<sup>[5]</sup>.
</br>   
-	Application Research Intern, Sina Weibo, 2019.6-2019.9
	-	I implemented BERT for blog classification in real-world production environments.
	-	I improved the two-tower models for keyword ranking.
</br>   
-	Application Researcher (including internship), Tencent AIPD, 2020.5-2022.5
	-	Mainly focused on strengthening NLU capabilities to enhance Tencent's news feed recommendations.
	-	I reformulated the Keyphrase Ranking task as a Machine Reading Comprehension task, which better considers the context and leverages pre-trained language models to improve performance.
	-	I developed a Keyphrase Prediction method based on a unified extract-and-generate architecture<sup>[6]</sup>. This approach combines extractive and generative tasks within a unified autoencoder and autoregressive language model, and it is the first to model the interaction between present and absent keyphrases.
	-	I explored Controllable Keyphrase Generation as an early attempt in prompt engineering<sup>[7]</sup>. This system employs specified topic keywords and automatically constructs prompts for LLMs to generate keyphrases, adhering to safety and customization requirements.
	-	Based on contrastive learning and information theory, I designed a fine-tuning schema that minimizes hallucination in LLM generated texts<sup>[8]</sup>.
</br>   
-	Application Researcher, Tencent MLPD, 2022.5-present
	-	Concentrated on improving the accuracy of Tencent Advertisement Recommendation in the view of model-centric and data-centric.
	-	Model-Centric: I developed various models to mine the relationship between user interests in the advertising field and Non-advertising fields (such as reading blogs, playing games, and watching videos). These models include graph embeddings, sequence modeling, and diffusion models. Additionally, I explored interaction-enhanced two-tower models to directly enhance CTR/CVR prediction accuracy in Tencent Ads.
	-	Data-Centric: Focusing on data-centric approaches, I developed model-based (rather than heuristic) feature quantization techniques to enhance the stability and performance of features used in large-scale advertising recommendation systems. I am also exploring feature AutoML techniques to automate feature engineering for Tencent Ads.
